# Rogue Guide

## Introduction:
Few archetypes are as enduring as the rogue.

From the calculated patience of Garrett, to the lethal efficiency of Arya Stark, to the silver-tongued audacity of Locke Lamora, the rogue fantasy is not about brute force. It is about leverage.

The rogue wins through positioning. Through timing. Through knowing something the enemy does not.

In **Pathfinder Second Edition**, the Rogue is one of the most tactically expressive classes in the system. It is not simply “the stealth class,” nor is it just a damage chassis for Sneak Attack. The Rogue is a precision striker, a battlefield opportunist, and arguably the most skill-dominant class in the game.

It rewards planning. It rewards awareness. It rewards system mastery.

And when piloted well, it is devastating.

### The Rogue’s True Role

At a glance, the Rogue appears straightforward:

- Apply [Off-Guard](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=58)
- Trigger [Sneak Attack](https://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=37)
- Deal extra damage

But this surface-level reading undersells the class.

The Rogue’s true strength lies in action efficiency and information control. It exploits small advantages better than almost any other class. A flanked enemy is not merely easier to hit — it becomes a liability. A successful Recall Knowledge check is not flavor — it is a damage trigger. A Demoralize action is not filler — it is the beginning of a cascade.

Where other classes force advantage, the Rogue capitalizes on it.

This distinction matters.

Rogues are not independent damage engines in the way Fighters or Barbarians can be. They are synergy amplifiers. They turn teamwork into precision damage. They convert battlefield chaos into calculated execution.

If you enjoy reading the field, manipulating conditions, and squeezing value out of every action, the Rogue is one of the most rewarding classes to master.

### What This Guide Covers

This guide will examine:

- The Rogue’s mechanical identity and core features
- A breakdown of each racket (subclass) and what it enables
- Attribute priorities and build foundations
- Ancestry synergies
- Class and skill feat evaluation
- Archetype combinations that meaningfully expand the chassis
- Equipment priorities and scaling
- Several complete build concepts inspired by iconic rogue archetypes

The goal is not to recreate the rulebook. It is to interpret it.

Every recommendation here is grounded in practical table performance — not white-room damage math alone, but action economy, survivability, party synergy, and long-term scaling.

## Who Should Play a Rogue?

Play a Rogue if you:

- Enjoy tactical positioning and battlefield awareness
- Want the most skill flexibility in the system
- Prefer precision over brute force
- Like turning small advantages into decisive victories
- Want a class that scales with player mastery

Avoid the Rogue if you:

- Want to stand toe-to-toe and trade hits
- Prefer straightforward, repeatable rotations
- Dislike relying on positioning or team coordination

The Rogue thrives in capable hands. It punishes autopilot.

But for players willing to engage with its depth, it offers one of the most satisfying mechanical experiences in Pathfinder 2e.
