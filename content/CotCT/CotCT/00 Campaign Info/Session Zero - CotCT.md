# Session Zero – Curse of the Crimson Throne

## 1. Campaign Overview
- Setting: [[Korvosa]], jewel of Varisia, now teetering on unrest after the king’s illness.
- Themes:
  - Urban intrigue
  - Corruption and tyranny
  - Personal vendettas against [[Gaedren Lamm]]
  - Loyalty vs. rebellion
- Style: Mix of roleplay, investigation, and urban combat.

---

## 2. Expectations & Tone
- Player-driven storylines matter — characters *must* have a reason to oppose Gaedren.
- Grey morality: Korvosa is not black-and-white; even "good" factions can be corrupt.
- Violence and injustice are part of the city — lines and veils discussed before play.

---

## 3. Lines & Veils (Safety Tools)
- **Lines** (hard no, won’t appear in game)
- **Veils** (can appear, but fade to black / off-screen)
- **Ask First** (check in with group before including)
