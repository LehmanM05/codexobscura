Codex Obscura is a growing archive of Pathfinder 2e character builds, class guides, and system analysis designed to be practical at the table.  
  
Each guide represents hours of research, mechanical exploration, and refinement to ensure builds are both effective and intentional.  
  
Support helps cover hosting costs, domain fees, and the continued expansion of the Codex.  
  
All content remains freely available — contributions are entirely voluntary.  
  
If a guide has helped shape your next character, consider supporting the project.
